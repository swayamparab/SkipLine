AI-Based Smart Queue Management System
Project Abstract
The AI-Based Smart Queue Management System is a web-based application designed to efficiently manage and optimize queues in places such as canteens, libraries, offices, and laboratories. Traditional queue systems cause overcrowding, long waiting times, and inefficient movement of people. This project aims to solve these issues by introducing a virtual queue system supported by artificial intelligence and data analytics.
Users can join queues digitally and receive a virtual token along with an estimated waiting time. The system continuously analyzes queue data such as queue length, service time, and peak hours to predict waiting time accurately using machine learning techniques. An admin dashboard is provided to monitor crowd density, manage queues, and make informed decisions during peak periods.
The project uses React for the frontend, Node.js with Express for the backend, Firebase for data storage and real-time updates, and Python-based machine learning models for prediction. By improving the flow and movement of people inside buildings, this system aligns with the IT for Smart Mobility theme by enhancing efficiency, safety, and user experience without involving transportation.

Problem Statement
Manual queue systems lead to overcrowding, increased waiting time, and poor management during peak hours. There is no real-time visibility or prediction of waiting time, which results in inefficient movement of people. Hence, a smart, AI-based queue management system is required.
